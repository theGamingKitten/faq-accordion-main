## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First time use of svg images. There are multiple ways to use SVG. Here are two ways I used them in this project.

```html
<object data="./assets/images/icon-star.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
```
```css
body {
  background-image: url("./assets/images/background-pattern-mobile.svg");
}
```
### Useful resources

- [SelfHTML (german)](https://wiki.selfhtml.org/wiki/SVG/Tutorials/Einstieg/Einbindung) - A good resource in german language for all things HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SVG
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) - used this "How to" to implement the accordion functionality
