## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First time use of svg images. There are multiple ways to use SVG. Here are two ways I used them in this project.

```html
<object data="./assets/images/icon-star.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
```
```css
body {
  background-image: url("./assets/images/background-pattern-mobile.svg");
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
